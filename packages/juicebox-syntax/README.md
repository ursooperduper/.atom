# Juicebox Syntax Theme

A dark syntax theme for Atom. Juicebox features bright, core colors alongside soft, flat-styled elements. This is a syntax theme only, and will not affect the Atom UI (it will work with Light or Dark UI schemes).

### Installation

Run the following command:

```sh
apm install juicebox-syntax
```

To activate the theme, open the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and select the Themes section from the left hand side. Simply select `Juicebox` from the `Syntax Themes` dropdown.
