:rotating_light: Not a 100% port just yet. Still a WIP.

Can be activated by going to the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the
_UI Themes_ drop-down menu.

This is a modified version with non rectangular tabs, that have a close button on the left, to match how Ubuntu, elementaryOS and OS X like there close buttons.
